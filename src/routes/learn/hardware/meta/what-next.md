Congratulations on making your way through the first chapter!

Unfortunately, this project is a free initiative and still very much a work in progress. More content should come soon! Until then, you can continue learning by following the existing content this project is based on.

Before you go, please consider:

- Giving us [feedback](https://github.com/durasj/chipsandcode/discussion) or [report a bug / request a feature](https://github.com/durasj/chipsandcode/issues).
- Helping us by [contributing learning content or code](https://github.com/durasj/chipsandcode).

# Continue Learning

This project was started as a reimagined [Nand2Tetris](https://nand2tetris.org/) (not affiliated or endorsed by them). You can continue on your journey by using their content. Unfortunately, it's not quite as convenient as you have to get a Java desktop application, but you will be hopefully fine. You just completed the first week of the content, so you have a solid head start. Let's hope we'll see you back soon!
