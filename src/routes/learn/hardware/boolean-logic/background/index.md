## Background

This chapter focuses on the construction of a family of simple chips called _Boolean gates_. Since Boolean gates are physical implementations of _Boolean functions_, we start with a brief treatment of Boolean algebra. We then show how Boolean gates implementing simple Boolean functions can be interconnected to deliver the functionality of more complex chips. We conclude the background section with a description of how hardware design is actually done in practice, using software simulation tools.
